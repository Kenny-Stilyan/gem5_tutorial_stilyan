The following is a README file describing the modifications
and including the diff output.

This is a possible README file that could be included 
in the 311.wupwise source modified to run with 310.wupwise 
data files.

This file contains descriptions of modifications to 
SPEC OMPL2001 311.fma3d source such that it will validate
when run with SPEC OMPM2001 310.wupwise data files

To help with making modifications manifest and 
make converion back to OMPL2001 source code possible, 
sections from the SPEC OMPL2001 suite are commented out
and marked.  Sections required for SPEC OMPM2001 are 
not commented out.

Modification descriptions:

SPEC OMPM2001 310.wupwise has the size of the problem
hardcoded into the benchmark.

SPEC OMPL2001 311.wupwise is modified so that the size 
of the problem is hardcoded into the benchmark instead 
of being read at runtime.
