This is largely the PBN OpenMP version of the NAS parallel benchmark LU
(APPLU), with major changes to JACLD, BLTS, JACU and BUTS to increase
the parallelism.  The compiled sizes of arrays have also been changed
to match SPEC's 173.applu benchmark.

A very simple makefile is provided.  Please adapt flags to suit your
compiler.  The sources are still split as from PBN, with an included
file.  There is also a wtime.c file to return wall clock time.  Expect
to rewrite this (Fortran or C) for your platform.

I have included the SPEC ref, train and test inputs in the form of
input.* files.  Their contents must be somehow put into a file named
inputlu.data to affect the run.  Reference files are in output.*, and I
have not matched the format up yet.  The verification tests are still
done in the NAS style, which does not recognize the train and ref data
sets, and claims they are UNSUCCESSFUL.  Inspection of the final
results is required to verify success.
